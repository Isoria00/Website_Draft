I developed a unique web application created with Flask, Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. While it serves as a personal project for my girlfriend, it also showcases my skills in building interactive, user-focused websites.

The website is fully responsive, allowing users to seamlessly access and interact with it from both desktop and mobile devices, making it convenient no matter where you are.

** Note: This application is currently not deployed. To access it, you will need to run the Flask application locally on your computer and connect via the local IP address. **

This project highlights my ability to blend functionality and creativity while building web applications, with a focus on delivering a personalized and accessible user experience.
